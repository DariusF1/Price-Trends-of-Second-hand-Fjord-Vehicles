# Price-Trends-of-Second-hand-Fjord-Vehicles

The first second-hand car I bought was a bug-eyed '03 VW Polo 1.2L petrol, pretty stylish for its age but a underpowered engine that purred instead of growled.

My next automobile was a Audi A3 2.0L petrol FSi that despite being equally ancient, also being built '03, thanks to Audi's "Vorsprung durch Technik" is ULEZ compliant to this day!

Finally post-Covid I splurged on a spaceship in terms of modernity (plus not being the same age as my little sister) - a '17 BMW X3 M-sport 2.0L diesel. No more cassette adapters, no sir.

Throughout the recent years I've followed the interesting [anomalous trends](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/the-global-pandemic-its-impact-on-the-used-car-market/) in used car prices as the underlying causes e.g. disruption of new vehicle supply chain, tightening of consumer budgets to purchase new cars...and nowhere to drive, fascinated me.
This inspired me to investigate the strength of relationship between vehicle characteristics and their price.
